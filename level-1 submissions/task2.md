Supervised Learning :
Definition: A type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data.
Goal: Learn a mapping from inputs to outputs to predict new data.
Example: Spam email classification (inputs: email content, output: spam or not spam).

Difference Between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning :
Supervised Learning:
Requires labeled data (input-output pairs).
Goal: Predict outputs from given inputs.
Example: Spam detection, stock price prediction.
Unsupervised Learning:
Uses unlabeled data (no output labels).
Goal: Find patterns or structures in the data.
Example: Clustering, anomaly detection.

Difference Between Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Learning :
Supervised Learning:
Learns from labeled data (correct output known).
Example: Classifying emails as spam or not.
Reinforcement Learning:
Learns by interacting with an environment (trial and error).
Receives rewards or penalties based on actions.
Example: A robot learning to navigate a maze based on rewards or penalties.
