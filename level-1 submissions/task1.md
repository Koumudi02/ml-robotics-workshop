# task 1: Basics of robotics 
The evolution of robotics has been shaped by various technological advancements, beginning with George C. Devol’s invention of a programmed material-handling device in 1954. This invention, incorporating the teach-in/playback method, laid the foundation for today’s industrial robots. The origins of modern robots lie in numerical control systems and remote manipulators. Numerical control enabled machines to perform various tasks based on stored data, fostering flexibility in manufacturing processes. This was vital as industries shifted from mass production to more adaptable systems to meet changing demands. Remote manipulators, developed for use in hazardous environments, replicated human movements through master-slave control mechanisms, influencing the design and functionality of robots.

Robots differ significantly from traditional machines, requiring greater mobility, dexterity, and autonomous control. They employ advanced designs, including serial linkages resembling human arms, which enhance flexibility but pose challenges in precision and control. Robotics research focuses on addressing these complexities through kinematics, dynamic analysis, and sophisticated control systems.

Robots also interact extensively with their environment, necessitating sensor-based systems for adaptability. Unlike master-slave manipulators, robots must autonomously plan and execute tasks, relying on programming and control algorithms. The study of manipulation tasks, including precise motion and force control, is critical for advancing robotics to meet industrial demands for skilled and efficient automation.
