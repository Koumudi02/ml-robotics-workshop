#SUMMARY 

#TASK 1:Regression Model
#Performance Metrics:
RMSE (Root Mean Square Error): Indicates the average magnitude of prediction errors. Lower values suggest better model performance.
R-squared (Coefficient of Determination): Measures how well the model explains the variance in the data. Values closer to 1 indicate a better fit.
#Observations:
A Linear Regression model may provide simple and interpretable results but could struggle with complex patterns.
Decision Tree Regressor might capture non-linear relationships better but could overfit on smaller datasets.
Feature importance analysis revealed the dominant impact of speed on predicting robot movement.
Visualization of predicted vs. actual values can reveal model bias and variance.

#Task 2:Classification Model 
#Evaluation Metrices:
Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions.
Precision: Focuses on the correctness of positive predictions.
Recall: Evaluates the ability to identify all positive cases.
#Confusion Matrix Insights Summary
The model achieved good accuracy with effective label predictions.
Precision and recall indicated balanced performance, though distinguishing between warning and critical states posed challenges.
The confusion matrix highlighted strong performance in identifying normal and critical states, with minor misclassifications in the warning category.
